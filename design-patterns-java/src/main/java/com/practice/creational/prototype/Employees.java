/**
 * Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair
 * and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object
 * already existing.
 * 
 * Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new
 * object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern
 * uses java cloning to copy the object.
 * 
 * Prototype Design Pattern Example It would be easy to understand prototype
 * design pattern with an example. Suppose we have an Object that loads data
 * from database. Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times,
 * so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all
 * the data again from database.
 * 
 * The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object
 * and then do the data manipulation.
 * 
 * Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying
 * should provide the copying feature. It should not be done by any other class.
 * However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends
 * on the requirements and its a design decision.
